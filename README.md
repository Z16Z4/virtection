# virtection
Anti-VM demonstration tool for malware researchers to calibrate their virtual environments

## Linux
```
sudo apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/cronos-hash/virtection.git
(install modules)
python3 main.py
```

## Windows
```
download .exe
 ```
 
## Purpose

This tool is currently being developed as part of my final project for Cyber Security and to help configurations during dynamic analysis of malware. Just like programs such as Metasploit help identify vulnerabilities. This program aims to assist in testing virtual environments against Anti-VM techniques As seen in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7kwdDMfKAg
I also aim to create a small community that may assist in updating virtection as new techniques are discovered.
